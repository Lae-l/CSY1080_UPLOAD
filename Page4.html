        <h2>Network Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          <h9>The specialisation that I am interested is Networks. 

            A Network Engineer is someone who is tasked with maintaining, creating and designing communication networks within a company or many different companies. A Network Engineer is a key role in today’s society as the largest way of communication these days is done electronically.  </h9>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <h9>There are many different types of networks, some of which you will be familiar with e.g. LANs and WANs. A LAN is a local area network which spans across a home, buildings or an office, these are smaller networks compared to WANs. Wide Area Networks aka WANs are networks that can span kilometres in radius. 
          
          </h9>
          
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
          
          <h9>Network Engineering really interests me as we take things for granted, e.g. sending texts, receiving mail or watching a video online. It all depends on networks and network speeds. The intricacy behind how networks are built have made me appreciate the hard work that they do and how far technology has come.
          
          </h9>
        
        </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p> 
          <h9>Cyber Security is also a role played by Network Engineers. They are the ones that create firewalls to protect companies and people from cyber-attacks. They create antivirus’ and anti-malware software for people to use. These are very important in preventing unauthorised access on your network by people who have ill intent. Data-loss prevention is also important aspect of Cyber Security as companies would not want their data to be lost through means like email, text messages or file transfers. Many companies do not enforce strict protocols to prevent this and it can become the detriment of the company itself. </h9>
        </p>
        <p> <h9>Firewalls prevent unauthorised access from outside untrusted sources of the internet to your own personal network. This is why you always get a prompt when installing new software on whether or not you want to open the file as it’s from an untrusted source.
