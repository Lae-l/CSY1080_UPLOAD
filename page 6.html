          <h9>My whole experience with Web Development has been very rocky. I found it quite hard to grasp the concepts of the tags and code used in web development. I think that in the future it would be best to try and read ahead with everything and ask the lecturer help with what I do not understand. I don’t believe web Development will be the road I’ll take in second year as I really do not enjoy it. Even so, it has been very interesting to learn and see your work construct right before your eyes. The whole struggle paid off in the end when you see your final web page. I think next time it would be better to collaborate with many different people and see many different ideas. Too look for different ways of making the page exciting will also help me greatly. Furthermore, I think it’s an eye opener as we do not appreciate the hard work that developers put in to make a web page itself.</h9>
