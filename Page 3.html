        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        
        
        <p> <h9>A Web Developer is responsible for the layout, design and coding of a website and web applications. They control how the sites work, how it looks and feel and some may also maintain the websites. A web developer needs to meet the certain needs of their client if they are working for an agency or freelance. They need to create a high performing product for their clients which will be accessed all over the internet.  


          Web developers can work on the ‘Front End’ of a website which is the design and visual interface while others work on the ‘Back End’ which usually entails the database and software of the website itself. Some may work on both development areas too. 

          To actually land a job as a Web Developer you would need a very wide skill set. Knowledge in languages such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript is a must. The level required for it depends on how big the company/client you are working for is. For instance, a prestigious company such as Barclays would only want the elite working for them as they work with sensitive data. Security plays a major role with their website and they would be looking for people to create, update and maintain their websites without breaking security. 

          •	Salaries for junior or entry level web developers starts from around £19,000-£25,000 a year

          •	Mid-level and senior web developers can expect to earn between £25,000 and £35,000 

          •	Top Developers can usually earn up to £50,000 or higher, depending on the company. 

          Salaries differ according to your geographical location. You would expect to earn more in London as there are larger companies hiring. Specialising in newer technologies can also lead to higher salaries. 

          Web developers usually work typical office hours (9am-5pm) but if you work for an agency you could face working longer hours at irregular times of the day.</h9></p>

        <h4>Games Developer</h4>
        <p><h9>A Games Developer is someone who’s involved in the creation and production of games for many different platforms such as computers, consoles, mobiles, tablets. Design and programming are the typical roles for a Games Developer.

          A games developer would almost never work alone. This is because the production, design and implementation can take years with teams of professionals. 

          The skill needed for a job also varies in relation to the prestige of the company you are working for. For example, one requirement out of eight needed to get a job at the Valve Corporation is 5 years of experience minimum using C ++ just to be eligible for an interview .

          Typical salaries for artists, animators and programmers in Games Development is between £19,000-£25,000 in relation to your geographical location . This is similar to a starting Web Developers salary.   

          The working hours for a games developer can be flexible depending on the employer. Usually you would work 40-hour weeks. Hours will increase as game deadlines come closer and so will the pressure. Evenings and weekends will have to be sacrificed in order to complete deadlines. 

          A relevant degree in web Development would increase your chances of getting a job, but you can also get a job if you have relevant experience. Most people who work in games however are graduates
